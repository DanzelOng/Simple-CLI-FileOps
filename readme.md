# Simple CLI File Ops
A Python program that makes creating or deleting Files and Folders easier through the terminal on Windows.
# Why?
Performing simple file operations through file explorer can be tedious and inefficient.

And for the average user, trying to do so through the Command Line Interface (CLI) can be 
even more confusing, and requires knowledge of the various commands.

With this program, users will be able to do all of this by simply entering digits and characters on the terminal!
